Perlin noise generator in Java by Hoten

www.hotengames.com

This library is capable of generating tileable perlin noise maps in one and two dimensions. 'Tileable' as in the edges connect seamlessly. For example, a 1-dimensional noise map could represent a line, and a tiled 1-dimensional noise map would represent a line that, when duplicated and laid side to side, would tile seamlessly.

In the drivers package you will find a few examples. Those include a tiled 1d graph, a tiled animated 1d graph (2 dimensions - one is in time), and a tiled 2d image. See samples/ for sample images.

Non-tiled noise maps are also supported.
